        "Ans.)A data structure is a method of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. It defines the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on it. Data structures are essential for writing efficient algorithms and programs. They help in managing large volumes of data by enabling easy access, modification, and storage. Common types of data structures include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, sets, dictionaries, trees, and graphs. Each type has its own strengths and is used in different situations based on the problem requirements. Choosing the right data structure improves the efficiency of the program in terms of both time and memory. Data structures are widely used in software development, databases, artificial intelligence, and various real-life applications like search engines, file systems, and social networks. Understanding data structures is fundamental to becoming a good programmer.\n",

This makes accessing, adding, or changing data very fast—even if the dictionary has many items.\n",

This makes dictionaries much faster when you need to look up data by a specific label, like finding a student's grade using their name.

For example, if you are storing the coordinates of a point on a map, like (10, 20), a tuple is a better choice because the location is fixed and should not be accidentally modified. Tuples are also slightly faster than lists, so they are useful when dealing with large numbers of read-only values.

        "Ans.)No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python. Tuples are **immutable**, which means once they are created, their values cannot be changed. This includes not being able to add, remove, or update any of the items inside them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason for this is that immutability helps protect data from accidental changes. It also allows Python to handle tuples more efficiently and makes them safe to use as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets. If you try to change a value in a tuple, Python will raise an error.\n",
